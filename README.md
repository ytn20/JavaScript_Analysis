# UFO Sightings Analysis with JavaScript

## Overview of the Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to analyze the UFO sightings data by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Using JavaScript, HTML and CSS we are able to create a interactive website that displays the different UFO sightings categorized by 7 fields. Using this website we are able to analyze the data and uncover some key findings which help us understand when and where the most UFO sightings occured. As well as things like the duration and type (shape) of each sighting. Users can filter through more than 110 sightings by data, city, state, country, and shape.

### How to perform a filter search

The following are the steps on how to perform a filter search to search by date, city, state, country and shape of each UFO sighting in this dataset. 

Step 1
    - Navigate to the Filter Search section on the main page of the webpage.

Step 2
    - Enter the different search criteria that you want to search each sighting by.
    - Enter the date when the sighting took place
    - Enter the city in which the sighting took place 
    - Enter the state in which the sighting took place
    - Enter the country in which the sighting took place
    - Enter the shape of the UFO sighting that took place

Step 3
    - Once you have filled in the above fields, click the Filter Table button to filter the data

Step 4
    - On the right side of the Filter Search you can see the results of your search

## Project Summary
Overall this page allows us to filter through over 100 data enteries to find the data entry that we want to search by. It provides an overview of the UFO Sightings as well as an opportunity to filter search by date, city, country. A drawback of the page is there is no clear explanation of how to perform a filter search. To improve this I would add in a small paragraph that explains the steps on how to perform the filter search. Two recommendations to improve the page are to include images of the UFO sightings as well as a section or form where Ufologists can discuss the different UFO sightings among themselves.
